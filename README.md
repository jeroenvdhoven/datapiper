# Datapiper
### A collection of tools for building testable data pipelines and making them deployable.

## Introduction
The application of data science has been growing more and more in recent years. More companies use it in their day-to-day operations and new techniques emerge every day. Building a simple model is easy enough, but doing it well remains an expertise. Getting one into production is an entirely different problem altogether. There are a few problems that keep recurring in the process of preprocessing, training, and deploying, such as:
    
    - Every preprocessing step applied to the train set needs to be repeated on the test and validation sets.
- Some preprocessing steps, like adding statistics, some forms of imputation, and one-hot encoding require a proper separation between train / test / validate sets. Since these steps use information from the train dataset and test / validate sets are supposed to mimick new unseen data, these steps should not use information from the test or validation data.
- Once a model is ready for deployment, the preprocessing steps need to be repeated on new and unseen data. Apart from that, the model tends to need to be able to integrate with other applications.

This is difficult enough. However, when we throw model selection, hyperparameter tuning, feature selection and different forms of preprocessing into the mix, the complexity grows quiclky.

## Goal
This package tries to address some of the above mentioned problems. Our solution is based on one that already exists in the data science community: pipelines. Trainable sequences of data transformations that can be repeated on new, unseen data. However, we provide some additional functionality, such as:
    
    - A large set of standardised and tested transformations.
- An easily extendable framework for including your own custom transformations. This only requires two functions per transformation: one to train it and one to apply it to new data.
- Easy testing of model, hyperparameter, and pipeline combinations.
- Turning your pipelines into standalone R packages, which can then be turned into a REST API via an OpenCPU Docker image.

All of this should help you be more efficient at testing different combinations of models and pipelines and bring machine learning models into production more easily.

## Usage

### Installation

For now datapiper is only available on github. Using devtools makes it easy to install the package:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("jeroenvdhoven/datapiper")
```

### Pipelines

As an example, start by taking a standard dataset and splitting it into a train and test set.

```{r}
dataset <- datasets::airquality
training_indices <- sample.int(nrow(dataset), .7 * nrow(dataset))
train <- dataset[training_indices,]
test <- dataset[-training_indices,]
```

The next step is to build the pipeline. Say we are interested in predicting the temperature using this dataset. The column names aren't nicely standardised, so we can do that first. The date can also be added using the month and day column. Next, the dataset has a few NA's in it, so we could apply some imputation. We can also generate some statistics for the month column.

```{r}
library(datapiper)
stat_functions <- list("mean" = mean)
year <- 1973

basic_pipeline <- train_pipeline(
    segment(.segment = pipe_function, f = standard_column_names),
    segment(.segment = pipe_mutate, 
            date = "as.Date(paste0(year, '-', month, '-', day))",
            distance_from_july = "as.numeric(difftime(as.Date(paste0(year, '-', 07, '-', 16)), date, units = 'days'))",
            date = "as.numeric(date)"),
    segment(.segment = pipe_impute, columns = c("ozone", "solar_r"), type = "mean"),
    segment(.segment = pipe_create_stats, stat_cols = 'month', response = 'temp', 
            functions = stat_functions, too_few_observations_cutoff = 10),
    segment(.segment = pipe_select, "-month", "-day")
)

pipe_result <- basic_pipeline(train)
train_trans <- invoke(pipe_result$pipe, train)
test_trans <- invoke(pipe_result$pipe, test)

print(head(train_trans))
print(head(test_trans))
```

Now your two starting datasets have been transformed in the same way using transformations that were trained using only the training dataset. Next to that, you now also have an object that can be used to reapply the same transformations to new datasets.

### Building a model

Once we have these datasets it's easy to train a model. We can now select:

- Different models with different sets of parameters.
- A target function to rank our models.
- Include a set of pipelines. For the following example we will use the same pipeline used above.

The result of this function is a new dataframe containing the parameters, models, pipeline(s), and the performance on the test and train sets.

```{r}
response <- "temp"

lm_model <- find_template_formula_and_data(response = response, training_function = lm)
rf_model <- find_template_formula_and_data(response = response, training_function = randomForest::randomForest, 
                                           ntree = c(10, 30, 50), nodesize = c(1,5, 10))

model_list <- list("lm" = lm_model, "rf" = rf_model)
pipe_list <- list("basic_pipe" = basic_pipeline)
rmse = function(x,y) mean(sqrt((x-y)^2))

model_results <- find_model(train = train, test = test, response = response, 
                            models = model_list, 
                            metrics = list("rmse" = rmse), 
                            prepend_data_checker = F, 
                            preprocess_pipes = pipe_list)

model_results <- model_results[order(model_results$test_rmse),]

print(find_expand_results(find_model_result = model_results))
```

With this result we can train our final model, combined with the appropriate pre-processing pipeline. This model can then be run on new data.

```{r}
model <- find_best_models(train = train, find_model_result = model_results, metric = "test_rmse", higher_is_better = F)

test_predictions <- invoke(model, test)
```

### Packaging

A good start to putting a model into production is to make it standalone. The pipeline helps us greatly with this, but we are still dependent on the environment we run in. The first step is to take our pipeline and put it in its own R package. This will allow us to easily transport the function without having to care about the dependencies (as much). Variables used by the pipelines will be contained within the package so we no longer depend on what variables are currenlty loaded in the environment. The package will allow you to call your model using either a dataframe or JSON argument, so you can use it when deployed on a remote server and locally.

```{r}
package_name <- "temperature.predictor"
tar_file_name <- "temperature.tar.gz"
libraries <- c("randomForest", "datapiper")

build_model_package(
    trained_pipeline = model, 
    package_name = package_name, 
    libraries = libraries, 
    tar_file = tar_file_name, 
    extra_functions = "year",
    may_overwrite_tar_file = F
)
install.packages(pkgs = "temperature.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

Let's remove the variables we don't need anymore. The package should be standalone at this point

```{r}
current_vars <- ls()
rm(list = current_vars[!current_vars %in% c("train", "test", "package_name", "tar_file_name", "libraries")])
```

And to get the predictions:
```{r}
temperature.predictor::predict_model(train)
temperature.predictor::predict_model(test)
```

### Docker

The logical next step is to make the package less dependent on the machine it's running on. One way of doing this is by building a Docker image that serves our model. To this end we use OpenCPU: a service that turns your R libraries into REST API's. This will allow us to create an image that can serve our model as a REST API when deployed.

Note: building the image can take some time and requires Docker to be installed on your machine.

```{r}
image_name = "temperature.image"
build_docker(model_library_file = tar_file_name, package_name = package_name, libraries = libraries, 
             docker_image_name = image_name, may_overwrite_docker_image = F)

test_docker(data = test, image_name = image_name, process_name = "docker.test", package_name = package_name, batch_size = 100)
```
